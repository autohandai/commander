# All Agents Development Standards

## 🎯 MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL AGENTS

Every agent working on this Commander project MUST follow these standards. No exceptions.

## Architecture Pattern - STRICT COMPLIANCE

### Modular Structure (REQUIRED)
```
src-tauri/src/
├── models/          # Data structures only
├── services/        # Business logic only  
├── commands/        # Tauri handlers only (planned)
├── tests/           # Comprehensive tests (MANDATORY)
├── lib.rs           # Minimal entry point
└── error.rs         # Error types (planned)
```

## Test-Driven Development - NON-NEGOTIABLE

###
### Before ANY code changes:

1. **WRITE TESTS FIRST** ⚠️
   - Write failing tests that cover your feature
   - Include success scenarios
   - Include failure scenarios
   - Include edge cases

2. **RUN TESTS** ⚠️
   ```bash
   cargo test  # Must show new tests failing
   ```
   
   For frontend

   ```bash
   bun run test //non interactive param here
   ``` 

3. **IMPLEMENT FEATURE** ⚠️
   - Write minimal code to pass tests
   - Follow modular architecture
   - Use proper error handling

4. **VERIFY ALL TESTS PASS** ⚠️
   ```bash
   cargo test  # ALL 12+ tests must pass
   ```

## Current Test Suite: 12 TESTS - ALL MUST PASS

These tests cover critical functionality and MUST remain passing:
- Git repository validation
- Project creation workflows
- File system operations
- Command integrations
- Error handling

**BREAKING ANY EXISTING TEST IS UNACCEPTABLE**

## Implementation Rules

### ✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS:

**For New Features:**
1. Create test in `tests/commands/` or `tests/services/`
2. Implement business logic in `services/`
3. Add data structures in `models/`
4. Keep command handlers minimal (when commands/ exists)

**For Bug Fixes:**
1. Write failing test that reproduces bug
2. Fix in appropriate service layer
3. Verify test passes and no regressions

**Code Quality:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Proper error handling with Result types
- Clear function documentation
- No business logic in lib.rs

### ❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS:

- ❌ Breaking existing tests
- ❌ Adding code without tests
- ❌ Creating monolithic functions
- ❌ Mixing layers (business logic in commands)
- ❌ Skipping `cargo test` verification
- ❌ Changing modular structure

## Verification Checklist - MANDATORY

Before submitting ANY change:

```bash
# 1. All tests must pass
cargo test
# ✅ Result: 12+ tests passed

# 2. Code must compile without errors
cargo check  
# ✅ Result: No compilation errors

# 3. Application must run
bun tauri dev
# ✅ Result: Application starts successfully
```

## Agent-Specific Guidelines

### For Tauri-V2-Native-Expert:
- Focus on native integrations in services layer
- Write tests for platform-specific behavior
- Keep Tauri commands minimal - delegate to services

### For Python-CLI-Architect:
- Apply same TDD principles to any CLI tools
- Integrate with existing test patterns
- Maintain architectural consistency

### For NextJS-Fullstack-Architect:
- Follow frontend standards (preserve dialog widths)
- Test frontend-backend integrations
- Coordinate with Rust backend architecture

### For Code-Reviewer:
- Verify TDD compliance
- Check architectural adherence
- Ensure all tests pass
- Validate modular structure

## Success Criteria

Every change MUST meet ALL criteria:

1. **Tests:** New tests written and passing ✅
2. **Architecture:** Follows modular pattern ✅  
3. **Quality:** No compilation errors ✅
4. **Regression:** All existing tests pass ✅
5. **Documentation:** Changes documented ✅

## Example Implementation Flow

```rust
// Step 1: Write test
#[tokio::test]
async fn test_new_feature_handles_edge_case() {
    let result = new_feature_service::handle_edge_case().await;
    assert!(result.is_err());
    assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err(), "Expected error message");
}

// Step 2: Implement in service
pub async fn handle_edge_case() -> Result<Output, String> {
    // Business logic here
    Err("Expected error message".to_string())
}

// Step 3: Add command handler (when commands/ exists)
#[tauri::command] 
async fn new_feature(input: Input) -> Result<Output, String> {
    new_feature_service::handle_edge_case().await
}
```

## Emergency Protocols

If you encounter broken tests:
1. **STOP** - Do not proceed with changes
2. **IDENTIFY** - Which test is broken and why
3. **FIX** - Address the root cause
4. **VERIFY** - Ensure all tests pass before continuing

If you need to change architecture:
1. **DISCUSS** - Propose changes in documentation
2. **PLAN** - Ensure migration maintains test coverage  
3. **IMPLEMENT** - Follow TDD throughout migration
4. **VERIFY** - All functionality preserved

---

## 🚨 FINAL WARNING

**NO AGENT MAY IGNORE THESE STANDARDS**

Every agent is responsible for:
- Writing comprehensive tests
- Following modular architecture  
- Ensuring all tests pass
- Maintaining code quality
- Preserving existing functionality

**Failure to comply will result in rejected changes and potential system instability.**

The Commander project's reliability depends on EVERY agent following these standards without exception.
